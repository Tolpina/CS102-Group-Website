                        For many Americans &mdash; politicians and citizens alike &mdash; it is difficult to admit that
                        corruption has become a primary driving force in our democracy. Taking on the many conflicts our

                    <h2>Ending Corruption in Washington</h2>
                    <p>Corruption in Washington has been a prevailing problem since soon after the creation of America's political system, hidden right under our noses and rarely confronted head-on. Under his radical new take on democracy, Gage plans to be open and honest about the corruption problem in the White House. <br> "Under an Anarchist regime, corruption can't occur," Gage is quoted saying in last week's . . .</p>

                        For many Americans &mdash; politicians and citizens alike &mdash; it is difficult to admit that
                        corruption has become a primary driving force in our democracy. Taking on the many conflicts our
                        country faces may seem impossible, but Gage does not shy away from the task. With his progressive new approach to the U.S. government &mdash; that is, the intigration of an <a href="#anarchy">Anarchist system</a> &mdash; he plans to knock
                        out issues that plague our democracy and political system, taking any action necessary to tackle
                        the serious flaws within our country that affect every single American. <b>Explore below how
                            Gage plans to

                    <h2>Ending Corruption in Washington</h2>
                    <p>Corruption in Washington has been a prevailing problem since soon after the creation of America's
                        political system, hidden right under our noses and rarely confronted head-on. Under his radical
                        new take on democracy, Gage plans to be open and honest about the corruption problem in the
                        White House. <br> "Under an Anarchist regime, corruption can't occur," Gage is quoted saying in
                        last week's . . .</p>

                    <h2>Forming a New, Functional Healthcare Plan</h2>
                    <p>Healthcare has long been a debate between politicians and citizens alike. From the Affordable
                        Care Act (ACA) to the newly instated American Health Care Act (AHCA), it seems impossible to
                        satisfy everyone. This is why Gabe has crafted a brilliant solution that gives everyone fair and
                        equal coverage. <br> "It's simple," he said at an Orlando rally. "To make it fair for all, I
                        propose retracting healthcare . . .</p>

                    <h2>Addressing the Immigration Dilemma</h2>
                    <p>America, due to our Democracy and many opportunities, is viewed as a haven &mdash; a place to
                        start over &mdash; for those outside of the U.S. This has sparked much debate among the American
                        people. Gage puts his solution in simple terms: "In the Anarchy that I propose, all those
                        'appealing' things about America will be eventually stripped away. This will decrease
                        immigration rates without having to take sides . . . </p>

                        Although most people have heard the term "anarchy," many don't understand what it actually means &mdash; especially in the context of today's political system. Gabe describes his version of anarchy in modern terms:
                        <br><br>
                        "Think of Anarchy as the next step past Socialism, except without any of the problems. Under an Anarchist reign, everyone is equal;
                        <b>I plan to strip away all corruption and unfairness through the abolishment of Democracy altogether. It's not Democracy, not Socialism &mdash; it's a complete lack of any sort of governmental system</b>," he explains. "The only one in a position of power will be me, but since no government really exists, I will hold no authority over the common people. We basically all just do whatever we want, and everyone is on equal ground."
                        <br><br>
                        When elected, Gage plans to implement a number of Anarchist policies during his four-year term. If all goes well, America will achieve an Anarchist Utopia by 2024!

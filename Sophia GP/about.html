            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Since childhood I always aspired to be a dictator, and at a grander scale, being the sole cause of world
                domination. My early flame of intrest was the catalyst that created my ambition surrounding my presedent
                canidacy. </p>

            <h3>Acadmics</h3>
            <p>I wemt to Yale and then later transferred to Western Washington University. I was drawn to WWU from its
                inclusive and diverse community, which was stark in contrast to Yales bleak and reclused environment.
                Through the analysis of both communities I came to the conclusion that chaos is the only solution to the
                break the secluded and individualistic systems seperationg people. So as your leader i will shall let
                anarchy reign. </p>

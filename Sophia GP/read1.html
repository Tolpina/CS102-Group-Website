        <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <p>Since childhood I always aspired to be a dictator, and at a grander scale, being the sole cause of world
                domination. My early flame of interest was the catalyst that created my ambition surrounding my
                president
                candidacy. Growing up in rural Indiana I had a busy and active childhood, and was instilled with the
                importance of hard work and fighting for your aspirations. I was raised in a bustling household with 12
                siblings, my parents and 7 estranged cousins. My father started a porcupine farmstead focussed on the
                raising/rehabilitation and and milking of porcupines. I had to work in the porcupine stables everyday
                from daybreak to dawn and every time I was pierced by by the sharp and unforgiving quills, I promised
                myself that I would leave Indiana and focus my hardened morals and foundation of hard work to something
                important, and of a national scale. On the day of my 18th birthday I left behind my humble life and the
                rolling hills and humid breeze of indiana and set off to the great unknown. I was not unbeknown to the
                struggles I would encounter in this seemingly new world, I had prepared for this moment since it was 8
                years old, every moment I wasn't in the stables I was researching the world and the subject of politics
                in order to prepare myself for my impending journey. I stayed up reading book after book next top the
                widow in my room using the moonlight to reveal the words until I had read every book in or school
                library and then the public library and anywhere else I could find. I spent my days working, my nights
                reading and any other bit of free time practicing my debating skills with my family. In 9th grade me and
                my debate team won Indiana's statewide debate contest and that was the first time my family realized my
                potential for a life in politics. My dad allowed me to volunteer as a student ta at my highschool
                instead of coming home to work on the farm, and when it was time for me to leave at age 18, they were
                sad but affirmed in my skills and were able to let me go. My upbringing allowed for me to find out what
                kind of person I was going to be and instilled in me the power in self-sustaining your thirst for
                knowledge and success. </p>

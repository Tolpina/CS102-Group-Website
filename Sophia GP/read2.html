            <p>I went to Yale and then later transferred to Western Washington University. I was drawn to WWU from its
                inclusive and diverse community, which was very different to Yales bleak and recluse environment.
                Through the analysis of both communities I came to the conclusion that chaos is the only solution to the
                break the secluded and individualistic systems separating people is through the collective overthrowing
                of all existing social systems. So as your leader I will shall let anarchy reign. Although my upbringing
                was stark in contrast to my peers, I beat all odds and graduated the top of my class at both Yale and
                WWU. I majored in political science and had a minor in business. I dedicated every day in college to my
                studies while also finding the time to get a part time job to start saving up campaign money. It was
                hard getting use to the different environments and at first I struggled in classes just because I was so
                unacquainted to my new lifestyle, but after a couple of weeks I got into the swing of things and got
                more invested in my work, only keeping my long term goals in mind. Upon graduation I was given numerous
                awards for my studies and student lead debates. Going to these universities of course helped expand my
                knowledge in politics, but more importantly, I was able to be fully emersed in to a totally different
                environment than I grew up, and was able to meet new people and develope a more accurate and solidified
                view of other cultures and populations.</p><br><br>

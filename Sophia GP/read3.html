        <h1>My Start In Politics</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <p>I began my start in politics after the mayor of Bellingham submitted a leave of absence and then
                mysteriously disappeared... I was the Mayor of Bellingham for 4 years, and although it was a good
                foundation for the beginning of my political journey I wanted to impact the world on a grander scale.
                During my years of being mayor I had a very overall positive rating and successfully passed all of my
                legislation by the city counsel. Although I seemed to be successful in my political career as a mayor I
                left my position and was elected to the U.S senate on november 4th, 2014 and have been actively serving
                tell present. I also had a supportive backing in my decisions in the senate, as I am not totally loyal
                to either the republican and democratic parties and I vote on legislation according to my personal
                values and if I think it will benefit the majority. Taking into account what I have learned during my
                time as mayor and a senator and all that I have learned as I've grown, I'm ready to face new horizons
                and fight bigger battles to provide Americans a truly just and coherent society. My presidency will
                break the barriers that have been restricting America from its true potential.</p><br><br>
